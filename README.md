# AST2210 - Observational astronomy

### Project 1: 
The aim of this assignment is to analyse spectroscopic observations taken by the Swedish 1-m Solar Tele-
scope (SST) on La Palma.

### Project 2:
The scientific goal of this assignment is to analyze the ionized gas kinematics in NGC 1365, using bright optical
emission lines such as the [OIII], the HÎ±, the [NII] transitions, and/or other emission lines you detect in the data. The learning goal is to get familiar with integral field spectroscopy (IFS) datasets and with the typical features observable in optical galaxy spectra.

Note that none of the project folders contain the data-files necessary to run the code as these were too large to upload.
